This is a basic implementation of Chord used to manage a MongoDB database with a single collection.\
Also, it provides indexing based on timestamps for the scenario of a Cloud Monitoring System for Virtual Nodes.

We simulated a scenario consisting of virtual machines on a data center. In short:\
The VMs are monitored by "scanners", which send the collected data to a RabbitMQ queue.\
A component, called Message Handler, receives the readings from the shared queue and forwards them to the Datamanager, which is a client for the distributed DB.

For the demo, the scenario was run in Dcoker through docker-compose.
