This is a basic implementation of Chord used to manage a MongoDB database with a single collection.\
Also, it provides indexing based on timestamps for the scenario of a Cloud Monitoring System for Virtual Nodes.

We simulated a scenario consisting of virtual machines in a data center. In short:\
The VMs are monitored by "scanners", which send the collected data to a RabbitMQ queue.\
A component, called Message Handler, receives the readings from the shared queue and forwards them to the Datamanager, which is a client for the distributed DB.

For the demo, the scenario was run in Docker through docker-compose.

### How to run the demo:
1. Clone this repository
1. Build the Maven project `allMaven`
1. In a shell:

```   
   $ cd docker/
   $ docker-compose up
```

You need to have the rights to bind port 80, and look at your SELinux policies if you use it.
